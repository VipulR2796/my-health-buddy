# My HEALTH Buddy

## Background
The idea behind this project occurs from the rising variety and frequency of health problems faced by people on regular basis. Good nutritional management contributes to the quality of life, helps maintain a healthy body weight, protects against infection, and reduces the risk of chronic conditions and premature death. Hence, comes the need for an application that can digitize the complete nutritional management as well as can use the data from users for further intelligence and insights. 

## Application Overview 
The main objective of this project is to let the user know what type of nutrition is he/she lagging behind or exceeding. In turn, this can be used to track the health nutrition management of the user. The application has various uses such as, notify the user about his nutritional limit, book appointment with dietician and hospitals etc.
